  <p>Hi there, thanks for checking out Daryl, a performant and simple theme for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I designed this theme to be as readable as possible, to be simple to use, and to keep the code used as vanilla as possible.</p>

<p>It’s open source for a reason: I’ve learned a lot from open source software and I’m trying to give a little something back. Hope you enjoy.</p>
